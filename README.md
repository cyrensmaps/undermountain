Welcome to Undermountain!
(Made by CyrensMaps & no1)

Thank you for using my module!

 

This module will create three compendiums. One for the scenes, one for this journal entry and one for a 
music playlist. This is needed so that everything is imported in the right way!

The scenes contain connections behind secret walls for expanded undegeon. Should you wish to use them 
just open up the secret doors. The secret doors are sometimes also two to make sure your players don't
accidentally notice them. 

The module has sound effects on a lot of the scenes. You can turn each of them off or on by going to the 
sound layer. If you can't hear them, please make sure your browser or foundry's sound is not muted.


I would also recommend using some additional modules to make use of every feature (NOT REQUIRED):

****Monk's Active Tile Triggers****
This controls all teleports and buttons in the scenes. Without it none of that will work.

****Perfect vision****
Makes vision a lot more in the line of what it's in DnD 5e.

****Lock view****
Helps out with foucusing the view to where players are when they enter a scene. (entry points for most 
levels assume the default point of entry, but in case of multiple of these, it is advised you edit 
the scene's configuration in advance to match your party's progress path at present)


All the love!
